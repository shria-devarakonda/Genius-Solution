So i solved a problem on codechef in a way that surprised even me. I wanted to show it off. The problem:


What is the maximum number of squares of size 2x2 that can be fit in a right angled isosceles triangle of base B.
One side of the square must be parallel to the base of the isosceles triangle.
Base is the shortest side of the triangle
